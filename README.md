# clusterer
A lightweight, configurable toolkit for unsupervised clustering of short or long texts. It builds vector embeddings for your data, discovers dense regions with HDBSCAN, optionally reduces dimensionality for visualization (e.g., t‑SNE), and exposes graph-friendly outputs for downstream exploration.
